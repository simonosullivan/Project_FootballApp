Wiki for my app - Quick to Goal

The app is very bare.
There is tab bar down the bottom with the 3 pages available
Home, Matches and Settings.

On the home page there is a Search bar, which you can search a team name and all the
teams matching that name will come up. I have found this to cause trouble as it seems
to only accept one team. For example you could open up the app, search Arsenal 
and it either comes up first time, or you have to go back and search it again for it
to come up. Once you want to search a new team however it seems to only show up with
the first team you searched, all the time. Not sure why it keeps doing this.

The home page is also suppose to show your favourite teams details but could not 
figure
out how to get teamId seperated and use it for api calls. It only shows the team you
selected from Settings. 

Settings also has the problem of when you click a team and hit save, it doesn't seem
to respond straight away. You have to go back to Settings page and then go home again
to see the name of team you clicked on the home page.

Matches page - This shows the matches on a certain date. Also shows the scores and 
details of the game if the game has been played by clicking on the game, it toggles
the imformation down. However, it toggles all the imformation down so you might have
scroll to find the right one.
